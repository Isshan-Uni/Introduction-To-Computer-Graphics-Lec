Reflection - In today's class we learned how shaders use UV0 and UV1 to map textures. We also learned how to add effects like rim lighting to the model through the material and have a realistic reflection surface with the help of a cubemap. I understood how world space can affect the pattern on the model and  how to expose the material properties like texture, cube, range, tiling, offset, color, etc. in the inspector in unity to handle the shader directly. My strength during this exercise was typing the code quickly. At first, I did struggle with syntax errors, but after asking for help, i was able to resolve them. I will say my weakness was debugging the code, but after some practice, I improved and started fixing it on my own. Another weakness was relying on autofill like I do in C#, which sometimes made me write the wrong code.
